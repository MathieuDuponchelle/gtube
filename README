The purpose of this project is to let users browse youtube
in a native interface using Gtk, and let them convert the video they just
watched / listened to to audio.

To launch it, use ./gtube.py

My use case is that I can only play CDs in my car, and moreover they need
to be raw PCM, not even MP3, and I was fed up with listening to a nice tune
on youtube, then downloading it with youtube-dl, then converting it,
and wanted to be able to do these three things in the same interface.

The project uses python 2

There is a basic check for unmet dependencies when launching the
executable, but we can list them here as well.

The components / required dependencies are :
    gdata (sudo easy_install gdata) -> for searching youtube
    youtube_dl (sudo pip install youtube_dl) -> for downloading from youtube
    recent gstreamer (distro dependent) -> for playing back / converting
    recent gtk (distro dependent) -> interface stuff + glib utilities
    soundcloud (sudo pip install soundcloud) -> for searching soundcloud
    rtmpdump -> for downloading certain feeds.

A lot of the code in there has been taken from the pitivi video editor,
the new bits are in converter_queue crawler, media_entry, service_interface and
youtube_service.

There is a config file that gets loaded, config.py.

It's a simple key value file, the constants are described in there.

Known bugs to fix :

Sometimes playback stops, didn't take the time to look at that.
